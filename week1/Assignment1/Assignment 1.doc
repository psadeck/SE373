In Node.js Create a server that will do the following:

When the user goes to http://localhost:3000/todo it will display the demo json file (todo.json or download it) 
with the content-type as "application/json". Display the file as is.

When the user goes to http://localhost:3000/index it will display an html page that will have your name and three things you 
like in an ordered list.  It can be about food, places you have visited etc.   Add two links on the page after the list. 
One for the todo page and the other for the read-todo page.

Create a third page called http://localhost:3000/read-todo .It will display an html page that will make an AJAX(fetch) 
request to  http://localhost:3000/todo (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. to get the JSON contents.  
Then loop through the content to display it in the HTML. 

Since there are three possible pages, have index be the default.  If I go to  http://localhost:3000/fake-page the index page 
should be shown. To do this you will need to redirect the user using the following syntax. 

/* Send the HTTP header
* HTTP Status: 301 : Moved Permanently
* Location:'http://' +  'The host of the requested location' + the path to the page that you want to be redirected to.
*/
response.writeHead(301, {'Location': "http://" + request.headers['host'] + '/index.html' });
